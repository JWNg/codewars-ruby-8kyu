#Description:
#
#subtract the sum
#
#Complete the function to get any number bigger than 10 and smaller than 10000, then:
#1. sum all the digits of the number.
#2. subtract the sum from the number, and it is your new number.
#3. if the new number is in the list return the associated fruit, otherwise return back to task 1.
#
#n = 325
#sum = 3+2+5 = 10
#n = 325-10 = 315 (not in the list)
#sum = 3+1+5 = 9
#n = 315-9 = 306 (not in the list)
#sum = 3+0+6 = 9
#n =306-9 = 297 (not in the list)
#.
#.
#.
#until you find the first n in the list below and return the fruit as string.
#
#There is no preloaded code, to help you.
#There is always an easy solution.
